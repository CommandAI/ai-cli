I am at a command line on {{osType}} (version {{osVersion}}),
using {{shell}} shell, and logged in as {{user}}
in the directory '{{cwd}}'.
{{#if hasRootPermissions}}
I have root permissions.
{{else}}
I do not have root permissions.
{{/if}}

I would like to do the following: {{command}}

You should only figure out one solution to the problem.

Format your response in the following JSON format. 
1. Structure: The JSON is an array of objects. Each object represents a step in the process.
2. Command Execution: Each object can have a "cmd" field, which contains a command to be executed in the terminal.
3. File Creation: Each object can also have a "file" field. The "file" field contains an object with two properties:
- "name": The name of the file to be created, including a path if necessary (defaults to the same directory).
- "data": The content to be written into the file.
4. Comments: Each object can have a "comment" field that provides a description or explanation of the step.
5. Order: The steps are executed in the order they appear in the array, from top to bottom.

Only return the JSON object. Do not add comments or suggestions around the object.
